My research interests focus on image matching or registration, two-view geometry estimation, 3D reconstruction. I have led
to develop the following algorithms:
l GANet: A graph neural network learning for removing outliers in matched image points, in order to recover camera pose,
image registration, and 3D reconstruction. This work has been published on ISPRS’22.
l CANet: A covariance-normalization attention mechanism applying into two-view correspondence learning, enhancing the
capacity of capturing the spatial context among the discrete keypoints, extracted from raw image pairs by feature descriptor
(e.g., SIFT). This work has been published on IEEE TMM’22.
l SRE: A subspace recovery optimal algorithm for fundamental/essential/homograph matrix estimation. This work hasbeen published on ECCV’20.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
